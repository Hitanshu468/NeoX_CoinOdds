# High-Low Game - Decentralized Blockchain Game

The High-Low Game is a decentralized game built on the blockchain, allowing players to predict whether the next number will be higher or lower than the previous one. This game integrates with smart contracts, ensuring a fair, transparent, and trustless gaming experience. Players can place bets and potentially win tokens by correctly predicting the outcomes.

## Features
- Play the High-Low game by predicting if the next number will be higher or lower.
- Use MEME tokens (or your token of choice) to place bets.
- Secure, trustless transactions powered by Ethereum smart contracts.
- Transparent and immutable transaction history on the blockchain.
- Integration with MetaMask for wallet connection and token management.
- Real-time updates for player balances, bet amounts, and attempts.

## Contract Details
- Contract Address: 0x\<your_contract_address_here>
- Network: Ethereum Testnet (e.g., Sepolia or Mantle Sepolia)

## Deployment
- Contract Address: View on Explorer
- Coin Used: MEME (or FINALCOIN) - FC

## How to Use
1. **Connect Wallet**: Players connect their wallet via MetaMask.
2. **Claim Tokens**: Players can claim MEME tokens to start playing.
3. **Place Bet**: Players enter their bet amount and select "Higher" or "Lower."
4. **Play the Game**: The game will evaluate the prediction, update the number, and check if the bet is correct.
5. **View Balance**: Players can view their current MEME coin balance and the number of attempts made.

## Frontend
The frontend is designed to interact with the High-Low Game smart contract. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and connects to the Ethereum blockchain using the Web3.js library.

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- **Library**: Web3.js for blockchain interaction
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Deploy the smart contract to a test network.
3. Configure the frontend to interact with the deployed contract.
4. Connect MetaMask to fund the contract and start placing bets.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more game variants with different types of predictions.
- Implement multi-player functionality to allow for competitive play.
- Real-time transaction history display for each user.
- Implement a leaderboards system to reward top players.
- Integration with IPFS to store game data and user statistics.
